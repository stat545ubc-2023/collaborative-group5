# STAT 545A Milestone 1
## Project Introduction

This project is the first Collaborative Project for the *STAT 545A* course in the Fall term of 2023. The group number is **5**, and the group members include: 
- **Jamie Kwon**
- **Nicole Howes**
- **Lu Dong Lai (Luke)**
- **Grace Kuo**

This project is the first collaborative projet in the STAT 545 in term 1, which is designed to provide basic skills for R and Github. This course is taught by Dr. Lucy Gao.

## Files in the project folder / GitHub repo
The following files are in the project's GitHub repository:
1. README file: README.md
  * This README file contains information about the collaborative project, including the names of our teammates, what each document contains, and how to run the code within the folder.
3. Teamwork Contract: TEAMWORK.md
  * The teamwork contract contains information on how we will be dividing roles and communicating with teammates.
4. Troubleshooting document: troubleshooting-1.md and troubleshooting-1.Rmd
  * The troubleshooting document addressed 3 issues with the code that was provided by Lucy and the teaching team. The issues have been corrected and explained under each comment, then uploaded as MD and Rmd files through R studio
 5. Troubleshooting document #2: troubleshooting-2.md and troubleshooting-2.Rmd
  * The second troubleshooting document was for Milestone #2 and addressed 11 errors in code provided by Lucy and the tecahing team. The issues were corrected and explained under each comment, then uploaded as MD and Rmd files through R studio.

## How to run the code that appears in the folder / GitHub repo
Markdown (md) files can be directly opened on the GitHub web interface or downloaded and opened in other text editors that support the .md format. 

In the troubleshooting-1.md file, the results of running R code are also displayed within the file. Of course, you can also copy the code and manually input it into the R console to verify the results. You can also open a new project on R studio by coping the link to our project on Github, opening a new project on R studio, and pasting the link. You can then knit the document to see the results.
