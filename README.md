3. Troubleshooting document: troubleshooting-1.md and troubleshooting-1.Rmd

## How to run the code that appears in the folder / GitHub repo
Markdown (md) files can be directly opened on the GitHub web interface or downloaded and opened in other text editors that support the md format. 

In the troubleshooting-1.md file, the results of running R code are also displayed within the file. Of course, you can also copy the code and manually input it into the R console to verify the results.
