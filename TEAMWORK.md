# Teamwork Contract

1. Division of Labour:
How will you divide the work required for this milestone? Be sure to include what work will be done individually so that the work in each teammate’s pull request has been identified.

 * Below is the division of labour for our group which we decided during our first group meeting! 
 * Every group member has a main task which they will make a pull request for followed by a review task in which they can review other's pull requests. 

 * Jamie's main task will be troubleshooting and Markdown Formatting. She will also review the teamwork contract. Nicole's main task will be creating the teamwork contract as well as reviewing the Readme document. Luke's main task will be editing the Readme file and reviewing the troubleshooting task. Grace's main task will be reviewing the Readme file and part of the teamwork contract as well as finally submitting the projet. We then will complete the Github issue task individually.
    
3. Timing:
When will you each aim to submit your pull requests, keeping in mind that another teammate will need to review your work? Warning: Do not submit your part of the project last minute. Your teammate’s review of your work may not be trivial: if there are errors, your team will need time to debug them.

 * All the pull requests will be done before Thursday after everyone has completed all their individual main tasks in order for the other members to look over each other's work and make any edits. After class on Thursday we plan to meet to discuss any issues we faced and review other's pull requests which should be done when we meet. This will then give us ample time to edit and submit our project milestone. 


4. Communication:
How will you communicate with each other? For example, will you be using both Slack and GitHub Issues? For what, exactly? How long will it realistically take you to respond to a message? Will you hold a regular meeting, or rely exclusively on asynchronous communication?

 * Our primary communication platform for team interactions will be Slack, where we will discuss role assignments and project updates. We will utilize GitHub Issues to address technical challenges within the project and manage push and pull requests. We encourage members to respond promptly, ideally within a few hours upon receiving a message, to facilitate effective asynchronous communication. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the demanding nature of graduate school and appreciate thoughtful responses by the end of the day to maintain a smooth workflow. Additionally, we will schedule a weekly meeting after class to provide project updates and engage in collaborative brainstorming on specific project components.
