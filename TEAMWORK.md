# Teamwork Contract

1. Division of Labour:
  * How will you divide the work required for this milestone? Be sure to include what work will be done individually, so that the work in each teammate’s pull request has been identified.
  * Jamie: troubleshooting, review contract
  * Nicole: teamwork contract, review readme, 
  * Luke: Readme file, review troubleshooting
  * Grace: review readme, submit projet
    
3. Timing:
  * When will you each aim to submit your pull requests, keeping in mind that another teammate will need to review your work? Warning: Do not submit your part of the project last-minute. Your teammate’s review of your work may not be trivial: if there are errors, your team will need time to debug them.
4. Communication:
  * How will you communicate with each other? For example, will you be using both Slack and GitHub Issues? For what, exactly? How long will it realistically take you to respond to a message? Will you hold a regular meeting, or rely exclusively on asynchronous communication?
